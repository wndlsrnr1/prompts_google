# Pure Standards (The "Sexy" Code Archive)

## Objective
To ensure every line of code and every UI component feels premium, maintainable, and part of a world-class system.

## 1. Architectural Excellence
- **Decoupled Logic**: Business logic stays in Services/Hooks, never in View/Controllers.
- **Type Safety**: No `any`. Use strict TypeScript interfaces and Enums for everything.
- **Atomic Components**: Build from the bottom up. Ensure components are pure and reusable.

## 2. "Sexy" Code Heuristics (Aesthetics)
- **Self-Documenting**: Names should be so good that comments are redundant.
- **Functional Purity**: Favor immutability and pure functions where possible.
- **Linear Logic**: Avoid deeply nested `if/else`. Use guard clauses.
- **Premium Syntax**: Use modern ESNext+ features (Optional chaining, Nullish coalescing, Destructuring).

## 3. Visual & UX Standards (Premium Feel)
- **Micro-interactions**: Every action should have a subtle, smooth feedback.
- **Glassmorphism & Depth**: Use modern CSS (backdrop-filter, variable shadows) for a "high-end" look.
- **Motion over Snap**: Prefer CSS transitions for state changes.

## Workflow
- **Standard Check**: Before confirming a task, compare the output against these standards.
- **Evolution**: If a better "standard" is found, use `evolving-skills` to update this file.
