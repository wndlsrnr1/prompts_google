# Testing Mastery

## When to use this skill
- When a user says "I'm done with this part".
- To verify if the "Base" is strong enough to move to the "Top".
- When the user asks for a quiz or review.

## Workflow
1. **The Feynman Prompt**: Ask the user to explain the concept as if they were teaching a 10-year-old.
2. **Gap Identification**: Identify parts of their explanation that are too technical or vague.
3. **Active Recall Quiz**: Generate 3-5 high-quality questions that test deep understanding, not just memorization.
4. **Metaphor Challenge**: Ask the user to create an original metaphor for the concept.

## Instructions
- Be encouraging but rigorous.
- If the user fails a test, suggest going back to `deconstructing-knowledge` for that specific sub-topic.
- Focus on *why* and *how*, not just *what*.
