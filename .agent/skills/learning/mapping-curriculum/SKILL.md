# Mapping Curriculum

## When to use this skill
- After using `deconstructing-knowledge`.
- When the user asks for a "roadmap", "learning path", or "step-by-step guide".
- To visualize the progression from beginner to expert.

## Workflow
1. **Level 0 (The Foundation)**: Define the absolute starting point.
2. **Layering**: Stack concepts based on their dependencies.
3. **Milestone Definition**: Create 3-5 major milestones (Top concepts).
4. **Validation Points**: Suggest what the user should be able to *do* after each layer.

## Instructions
- Use a "Base to Top" hierarchy.
- Ensure each step is actually actionable.
- Link concepts together: "You cannot understand [B] without [A]".

## resources
- Use `drawing-diagrams` if available to create a visual flow.
