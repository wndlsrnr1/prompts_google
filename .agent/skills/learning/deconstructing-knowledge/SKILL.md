description: Breaks down complex topics or keywords into fundamental "atomic" units using First Principles thinking. Use when starting a new learning journey or when a topic feels too complex.

# Deconstructing Knowledge

## When to use this skill
- When a user provides a broad or complex keyword (e.g., "Quantum Computing", "Deep Learning").
- When you need to identify the "Base" components of a "Base to Top" learning path.
- When the user asks to "break down" or "analyze" a subject.

## Workflow
1. **Identify the Core**: Define the subject in its simplest form.
2. **First Principles Analysis**: Ask "What are the fundamental truths that don't depend on anything else?"
3. **Atomic Decomposition**: List the 5-10 essential concepts that must be understood first.
4. **Identify Dependencies**: For each concept, note what other knowledge is required.

## Instructions
- Avoid buzzwords; focus on underlying mechanisms.
- Categorize components into:
  - **Prerequisites**: What you need to know before.
  - **Core Atoms**: The building blocks.
  - **Emergent Properties**: How atoms combine to create the complex topic.

## Example Output
**Topic:** Web Development
- **Atoms:** HTTP Protocol, HTML Structure, CSS Box Model, JS Event Loop.
- **Dependencies:** Basic internet logic -> HTTP -> HTML/CSS.
