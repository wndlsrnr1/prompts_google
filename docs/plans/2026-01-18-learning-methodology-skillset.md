# Learning Methodology Skillset Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Build a comprehensive "Base to Top" learning system by creating specialized skills and a unifying workflow.

**Architecture:** Create three atomic skills (Deconstruction, Mapping, Testing) and one master workflow that orchestrates them using the Antigravity protocol.

**Tech Stack:** Antigravity Skills (Markdown + YAML), Antigravity Workflows (Markdown).

### Task 1: Create `deconstructing-knowledge` skill
**Files:**
- Create: `.agent/skills/common/deconstructing-knowledge/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Write SKILL.md**
Content will focus on First Principles thinking and breaking topics into "Atoms".

### Task 2: Create `mapping-curriculum` skill
**Files:**
- Create: `.agent/skills/common/mapping-curriculum/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Write SKILL.md**
Content will focus on identifying dependencies and creating a "Base to Top" roadmap.

### Task 3: Create `testing-mastery` skill
**Files:**
- Create: `.agent/skills/common/testing-mastery/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Write SKILL.md**
Content will focus on the Feynman Technique and active recall generation.

### Task 4: Create `learn-topic` workflow
**Files:**
- Create: `.agent/workflows/learn-topic.md`

**Step 1: Write workflow**
Orchestrate the three skills above into a repeatable process.

### Task 5: Update SKILL_INDEX.md
**Files:**
- Modify: `.agent/SKILL_INDEX.md`

**Step 1: Add new skills to index**
Ensure the agent can discover these new capabilities.
